## Data Visualization

Data visualization is one of my favorite aspects of frontend engineering.
It is very fulfilling to present data in an interesting and useful way,
and an even greater challenge to build the means to do so.

Data visualization also presents interesting domain concerns. You have to
understand the data to present it well. And UX studies are hard because people
are often embarrassed to tell you that they don't understand something, so
it usually won't come up as unprompted feedback.

Intellectual honesty is also very important in data visualization. You can easily
make the data look better or worse with small visual tweaks &mdash; rescaling the
axes, adjusting the color scheme, adding extra horizontal grid lines, etc.
