### Welcome

Welcome to my website. I plan to add tutorials and examples of different
aspects of [data visualization](/dataviz), testing and browser performance.

I hope to share some of what I've learned and provide some examples of what
visualizations can look like. It's also a fun place to try different approaches.

Testing and browser performance interest me a lot, too. I plan to come back
to those topics shortly.

Observability is the confluence of data visualization, performance and
testing, and that's why I'm so drawn to the space. I may also write about
that.

I will not write about jobs, skills or post a resume here. See my
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tedpennings/) if you are curious
about that.
