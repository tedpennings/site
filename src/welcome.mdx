### Welcome

Welcome to my website. I plan to add tutorial and examples of different
aspects of [data visualization](/dataviz), testing and performance &mdash; mostly
browser performance.

I hope to share some of what I've learned and provide some examples of what
visualizations can look like

This website has various writings and examples
of data visualization techniques using React. It also includes examples
of how to test those visualizations &mdash; to support presenting those
visualizations as part of a serious product.

Observability is the confluence of data visualization, performance and
testing, and that's why I'm so drawn to the space.
