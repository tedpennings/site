## Heatmaps

Heatmaps are basic visualizations where color communicates the data, either with
the brightness/intensity of the color or a change in the hue, like a gradient or
a rainbow.

A heatmap involves mapping an input domain, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` to an output domain,
say, `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`. This can happen in a few different ways:

- CSS `opacity` setting, `0` to `1.0`.

- Defining a color spectrum to interpolate hex codes for given values, as shown below.

- Setting specific color stops, so your heatmap shows just a few colors. This is common
  in <ImageTooltip imgSrc={electoralMap} href='https://270towin.com/' source='270toWin'>electoral college heat
  maps</ImageTooltip>, showing the party leaning of a state as _safe_, _likely_, _leans_,
  _toss up_, and wrapping back to _leans_ and _safe_ for the opposite party. This is
  just a heatmap with specific intervals/stops.
