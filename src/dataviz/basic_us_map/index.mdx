## Basic US Map

This is a basic map visualization &mdash; a basic spatial
visualization where we show a dimension of data across a geography.

### WIP

I'm working on this! I need to write about [heatmaps](/dataviz/heatmaps) first!

#### Gather the assets

There are two basic ingredients, a **map vector image** and a **data set**.

The images are often the easy part. Wikipedia has some amazing maps for
[the US](<https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blank_US_Map_(states_only).svg>)
and for [the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BlankMap-World.png) and
[more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Blank_maps).
You can find lots more elsewhere, [lists of earth projections](https://gisgeography.com/map-projection-types/)
and fun projections like [the Fuller Projection](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fuller_projection.svg).

You could also use a map library like Google Maps, Leaflet or Open
Layers. These will usually require that you place a dataviz layer on
top of the map layer(s). The concepts are the same as this article,
but you may also need to position the elements in your dataviz layers
(using points/centroids, bounding boxes, spread radii, etc). These
libraries do offer flexibility: earth projections, political
boundaries, toggles for levels of detail, etc.

In this article we're using an off-the-shelf map that has layers
for each element in our dataset, so we have a single layer with our
map vector image and our dataviz element together.

For the data set, I'm going to use infant mortality rates. When I
lost my son Pablo, I assumed it was unusual and an aberration. It
turns out it happens more often than you'd think, as you can see
below. The US CDC provides
[infant mortality reports](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr69/NVSR-69-7-508.pdf#page=15&zoom=100,0,0),
broken down by state, among other axes. This will need to be
translated from PDF text form into JSON (or similar). There are often
other ways to get this data, like [data.gov](https://data.gov) and
[wonder.cdc.gov](https://wonder.cdc.gov). I found the same data from
that PDF on [wonder.cdc.gov](https://wonder.cdc.gov), downloaded the
tab-separated data and found [a converter](https://shancarter.github.io/mr-data-converter/)
to make it JSON. Done.
