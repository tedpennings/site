## Pablo Valentine Pennings

##### Pablo was born on November 11, 2017.

Pablo was born early at 33 weeks, 3 days. He weighed 1490g, placing him just at the edge of
the very low birth weight category (3lbs, 3oz). Pablo went to the NICU right away. But we were
so happy that he was alive.

Jen's pregnancy was problematic. Pablo was in fetal distress when he was born by emergency
C-section. Jen had [ICP](https://icpcare.org/), a pregnancy condition where bile acids
poison the baby and restrict grwoth. We were lucky that a growth ultrasound showed
that he was not growing &mdash; he measured at the growth level of 28 weeks when he was
at 33 weeks. Jen had her first fetal monitoring the day after that growth ultrasound.
Pablo's heartbeat was hard to find. Jen was admitted to the hospital for overnight monitoring
and Pablo was born by emergency C-section in the morning. Everything turned out okay.

##### We had nine beautiful days with Pablo.

We loved spending time with Pablo in the NICU. Jen pushed herself so hard to be there as much
as she could &mdash; all while she recovered from her C-section.

Pablo was doing very well. He was able to breathe on his own at birth and checked out ok on the preemie
rankings. He did have [CPAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_positive_airway_pressure#Pre-term_infants)
for a day to help his lungs strengthen, and they did. He tolerated his feedings. He didn't have any
significant health issues &mdash; aside from being very small.

I loved how he always seemed to notice when I was nearby. I tried to deliver milk quietly, sneakily, and
he somehow knew that I was there. He wanted to play when I was around. And when he was with Jen, he was
at ease and wanted to sleep.

##### Pablo died on his tenth day.

Pablo died from [necrotizing enterocolitis](https://necsociety.org/nec-now/), a bacterial infection in
the intestines that causes the tissue to perforate and die. The word **devastating** is usually used to
describe it, both in [encyclopedic articles](https://www.chla.org/necrotizing-enterocolitis)
and in [many medical articles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=necrotizing%20enterocolitis%20devastating).
It was devastating. Pablo couldn't move for hours. His abdomen swelled for hours before he died, crushing
his lungs; we watched the respiratory therapist helplessly adjust his blood oxygen, again, and again.
Pablo had the most intense look of pain in his eyes. I held his tiny hand for hours. As we left
for him to have surgery, he threw his arms up in the air &mdash; it was the first time he had moved in
hours, and the last time. The surgery confirmed what we all saw. We held him, and he died. His death
was peaceful and a relief from those indescribable hours.

Pablo was thriving 12 hours before he died. And then he was gone.

##### After Pablo's death.

Jen and I have many happy memories of our son. We love talking about his goofy quirks, like the
killing-you-with-my-eyes faces he would make when he had a dirty diaper or a nurse had to do
something he didn't want done.

I think often about the things I would like to do with him, where I would like to travel with him,
all of the things I wish I could teach him. After he died they felt even more real. It felt like
I had lost future memories.

##### The grief.

Too often people write about infant loss without describing what happens after. Infant loss &mdash; and
grief &mdash; is not just about the person who died.

Pablo's death was devastating for me and for Jen. The grief was incredible, as you'd expect. Nightmares, yes.
Seeing or hearing babies becomes triggering, true.

But it was more than that. His death left both of us intense PTSD from what we saw, and the encounter with
life's fragility. Every time I saw a picture of an infant, I thought it was dead.
I had **overwhelming** depression for about eight months. Pablo's death triggered OCD and anxiety, and destroyed
my trust in other people. I'm so thankful that I had support and good mental health providers to help me.

I am willing to talk about this personally with anyone who's had a similar loss. Jen is very active in
support groups for infant loss, NEC and ICP.
