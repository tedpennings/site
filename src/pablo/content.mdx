## Pablo Valentine Pennings

##### Pablo was born on November 11, 2017.

Pablo was born early at 33 weeks, 3 days. He weighed 1490g (3lbs, 3oz), placing him just at the edge of
the very low birth weight category. Pablo went to the NICU right away. But we were so happy that he was alive.

Jen's pregnancy was problematic. Pablo was in fetal distress when he was born by emergency
C-section. Jen had [ICP](https://icpcare.org/), a pregnancy condition where bile acids
poison the baby and restrict growth. We were lucky that a growth ultrasound showed
that he was not growing &mdash; he measured at the growth level of 28 weeks when he was
at 33 weeks. Jen had her first fetal monitoring appointment the day after that growth ultrasound.
Pablo's heartbeat was hard to find. Jen was admitted to the hospital for overnight monitoring
and Pablo was born by emergency C-section in the morning.

Everything turned out okay. Pablo was born healthy.

##### We had nine beautiful days with Pablo.

We loved spending time with Pablo in the NICU. Jen pushed herself so hard to be there as much
as she could &mdash; all while she recovered from her C-section.

Pablo was doing very well. He was able to breathe on his own at birth and checked out ok on the preemie
rankings. He did have [CPAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_positive_airway_pressure#Pre-term_infants)
for a day to strengthen his lungs, and they did strengthen. He tolerated his feedings. He didn't have any
significant health issues &mdash; aside from being very small. He looked fragile; he was not. He was
surprisingly strong and we could hold him like a full-term baby (plus IV and monitoring leads).

We loved seeing him grow. We loved seeing his progress: lungs strong enough to stop CPAP, increasing feeding volume,
no IVs. It was so exciting. We felt more love for him every day.

I was amazed at how he always noticed when I was nearby. I often tried to deliver milk quietly, sneakily, and
he somehow knew that I was there. He would wake up and stretch his arms longingly. He wanted to play when I was
around. And when he was with Jen, he was at ease and wanted to sleep.

The first time I held Pablo, I didn't want to let go. I held him for about three hours. He was on my chest,
sleeping with [skin-to-skin contact](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/pediatric-newborn-medicine/nicu/skin-to-skin-care).
Time stopped. I felt so much love for him, so at ease and relaxed. We both did. This was the most time that Pablo
and I had, just the two of us.

##### Pablo died on his tenth day.

Pablo died from [necrotizing enterocolitis](https://necsociety.org/nec-now/), a bacterial infection in
the intestines that causes the tissue to perforate and die. The word **devastating** is often used to
describe it, both in [encyclopedic articles](https://www.chla.org/necrotizing-enterocolitis)
and in [many medical articles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=necrotizing%20enterocolitis%20devastating).
It was devastating. Pablo couldn't move for hours. His abdomen swelled and crushed his lungs for hours before
he died; we watched the respiratory therapist helplessly adjust his blood oxygen, again, and again.
Pablo had the most intense look of pain in his eyes. We watched him suffer for hours. We couldn't do anything.
I held his tiny hand for hours &mdash; it was the only thing I could do. As we left for him to have surgery,
as I let go of his hand, he threw his arms up in the air. It was the first time he had moved in hours, and
the last time. He knew we were leaving, and I think he knew he would not see us again. The surgery confirmed
what we all saw. We held him, and he died. His death was peaceful and a relief from those indescribable hours.

Twelve hours before, Pablo was thriving. And then he was gone. Pablo died November 21, 2017, two days before Thanksgiving.

##### After Pablo's death.

Jen and I have many happy memories of our son. We love talking about his goofy quirks, like the
killing-you-with-my-eyes faces he would make when he had a dirty diaper or a nurse had to do
something he didn't want done.

I think often about the things I would like to do with him, where I would like to travel with him,
all of the things I wish I could teach him. After he died they felt even more real. It felt like
I had lost future memories.

The emptiness of infant loss is immense. Your life has been organized around to this event, around the birth
of your child, and then it falls apart.

##### The grief.

Too often people write about infant loss without describing what happens after. Infant loss &mdash; and
grief &mdash; is not just about the person who died.

Pablo's death was devastating for me and for Jen. The grief was incredible, as you'd expect. Nightmares, yes.
Seeing or hearing babies becomes triggering, true.

But it was more than that. It was trauma. His death left both of us intense PTSD from what we saw,
and the encounter with life's fragility. Every time I saw a picture of an infant, I thought it was dead.
I had **overwhelming** depression for about eight months. Pablo's death triggered OCD and anxiety, and destroyed
my trust in other people. I'm so thankful that I had support and good mental health providers to help me.

I am willing to talk about this personally with anyone who's had a similar loss. Jen is very active in
support groups for infant loss, NEC and ICP.

##### How we remember Pablo today.

The grief is hard and painful and bad, like all grief. And of course there are also ways to celebrate the
positive memories and the love.

Peonies remind us of Pablo. A peony emerged by surprise in our garden the spring after he died. It grew
out of river rocks in the middle of a path. (The yard was redone before we bought the house the year earlier.)
I transplanted it and it blooms every year. We've since planted seven more. In the picture above, the peonies
around the heart ash urn are from that plant, from our garden. Mature, "double" peonies are about the size that
Pablo's head was &mdash; nearly softball sized. They smell incredible, and last about ten days... We visit
[Adelman Peony Gardens](https://peonyparadise.com/) as much as we can during the spring bloom (photo above).

We discovered [the Amazing Race](https://www.cbs.com/shows/amazing_race/) after Pablo died and watched
about ten seasons in those first few weeks. The show reminded us of what we loved about traveling,
gave us hope for what we could do in the future and let us laugh some of the problems people have on
the show. This helped us cope as we both worked with our grief. We still watch it &mdash; we've seen
all of the seasons. Maybe some day you'll see Jen and me on there.

I do not drink alcohol as a way to remember Pablo. Jen and I both carry &mdash; but do not have &mdash; the
genes for a [liver and lung condition](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency).
It can cause liver and lung damage, and there's a family history of it being very aggressive. Pablo got
those genes, both of them, and had the deficiency. So it would have been best for him not to drink alcohol
or smoke. I do not smoke, and wanted to set a good example for him and decided that I would not drink again.
I still do not drink.
