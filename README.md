=====================

This is the code for my website. It is *UNDER CONSTRUCTION* and hopefully launching soon.

## Developing locally
* Clone the repo and `cd` into it
* `npm install`
* `npm start` and go to the URL provided.

## Deployments
* TBD! Likely a travis-ci build pushing to GitHub pages or an S3 bucket.
